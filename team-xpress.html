            <h4>About</h4>
            <p><a href="https://www.celayix.com" target="_blank">Celayix Software</a> provides an extensive suite of workforce management tools that includes employee scheduling software, time & attendance, and employee communication. Solutions are designed to meet the needs of small and medium businesses while addressing the complexity of enterprise organizations.</p>
            <p><b>Team Xpress</b> is a mobile and web app for team members to keep track of their schedules and timesheets or timecards, and communicate with their supervisors, and perform clock actions.</p>
            <h4>Role</h4>
            <p>As the first and sole in-house designer for my first year and a half with Celayix, I led the product redesign of their mobile and web apps from conception to launch and beyond. Working in an agile and collaborative environment, I had the wonderful opportunity to work across multiple teams and projects at different phases of the product design and development process.</p>
            <p>Being part of the development team, I worked extensively with the software manager, PM, BA, QAs, and front- and back-end developers and architects. Given most of my teammates come from a computer-science and engineering background, it was important for me to advocate UX design methodologies and transfer UX knowledge to ensure our products are user-friendly and usable.</p>
            <p>Through the process of asking questions, gathering and translating business requirements and user needs, and understanding the problem space, I could take broad and conceptual ideas and turn them into useful and valuable solutions for our customers.</p>
            <p>In addition to UI/UX design, I worked with the marketing team to design promotional materials such as product tours, brochures, whitepapers, and online advertisements. Check out some examples below:</p>

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <h4>Understanding the problem</h4>
            <p>
              During the first few weeks at Celayix, the business analyst and product specialist gave me an overview of our existing product and how it works. It was clear the feature set outnumbered many of our competitors, but the convoluted labyrinth of modal windows made for a difficult-to-use interface and confusing experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              When familiarizing myself with the product, I realised that many areas of the system had been sewn together as independent patches without careful consideration for the current design and workflow. One reason for this messy interface can be accredited to all the customer requests for custom work and tailored solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although Celayix does offer scheduling capabilities towards a higher-level of specificity to meet the unique needs of their customers, it is easy for the system to become chaotic with all the different functionalities and moving parts. When it came to the redesign, I knew it had to align with the mission at Celayix, which is to make scheduling easy. This means to keep the interface minimal and the experience simple. Complex does not mean complicated.

            <h4>Developing a visual language</h4>
            <p>
              To communicate fluently in a language with another person, it is necessary for both parties to have a shared depth of vocabulary, proper style, and correct grammar. Like communication between an interface and its users, they must share a common and understandable language. This means, the breadth of UI elements and patterns must have identifiable characteristics and defined behaviours.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although each UI element is distinct, it cannot be independently designed as they do not function alone. Just like how a conversation is this interactive communication between two or more people, an interface is between the system and its users. Every UI element interacts with and relates to its neighbouring elements. Hence, it is important to develop a relationship between the elements and how they work in parallel with each other, be it within a component or pattern.
            </p>
            <p>
              When developing a visual language, it was important to design the common components to be adaptable and reusable to support our multiple products, platforms, and devices. Being that we are creating hybrid mobile and web apps, we cannot simply adopt Google Material Design for Android and Apple Design for iOS platform verbatim. Each component had to be meticulously crafted from scratch, making it highly customizable and flexible to the needs of our users. In addition, each UI element is responsive to both mobile and desktop screen sizes and touch and non-touch devices.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once the UI vocabulary and grammar was understood, it became easier to create a manageable and cohesive experience between the design and development. Since the UI elements and patterns share a common language, it can be repeated and scaled across multiple products and devices. As well, the user interaction and screen flow have a consistent behaviour that allows our users to learn and familiarize themselves with the system.

            <h4>Gathering Feedback</h4>
            <p>
              I solicited feedback from different stakeholders of the company at each stage of the design process. 
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Define:</b> When given a new task or feature, I would meet with the Director of Software Engineering (my manager), PM, and BA to define the problem and collect information about the needs of our users and the needs of our business.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Ideate:</b> I would communicate the concepts, user flows, and screen flows through sketches and mock-ups with the team to generate feedback and flesh out ideas.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Prototype:</b> Once the lo-fi sketches/mock-ups transitioned into high-fidelity wireframes, I validated the ideas of how a feature is going to work with the different stakeholders of the company, especially with the developers and QA.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Build:</b> During the UI implementation phase, I worked closely with both the front-end and back-end developers to bridge the gap between design and development. Once I understood the feasibility of the UI given our time and technical constraints, compromises had to be made.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Analyze:</b> I received feedback and addressed usability issues from QA. As well, the PM and Customer Success Team would forward me any complaints and suggestions from our customers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Being a fresh grad and the sole designer, I learned how to build my creative confidence at Celayix. I learned when and how to compromise, and to always be an advocate for good design.
